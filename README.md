# Vehicles-parking-lot
This code defines a parking lot simulation that allows vehicles to enter and exit the lot. The parking lot is represented as a 2-dimensional list of spaces, where each space can be occupied by a single vehicle. Vehicles can be of three types: car, truck, or motorcycle. When a vehicle enters the lot, it is assigned to the first available space that can accommodate its type. The user can view the state of the parking lot and select a row and space to add or remove a vehicle. When a vehicle exits the lot, the duration of its stay is calculated and the user is shown the fare for their parking session.
Jupyter or idle is required to run this project
